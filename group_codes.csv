In Group 58, more than in any other group, it frequently happens that the same name is listed as an index entry in each of several classes. In addition, that name may also appear as an entry in groups other than 58. Each such entry refers to a distinctly different part or assembly, even though the different items have the same name. The listing of the same names in two or more classes indicates that, in one form, the part or assembly covered by the name is applicable to the equipment covered by one class, and in another form is applicable to the equipment covered by another class. For example, the item name CODER, AUDIO FREQUENCY is applicable to two distinctly different assemblies, one of which has an application in cryptologic equipment, covered by Class 5810, and the other in radar equipment covered by Class 5840. Consequently the name CODER, AUDIO FREQUENCY is an entry under each of the two classes.  When an item identification bears a name which is indexed under more than one class of Group 58, or in Group 58 and in some other group, the item will be classified in the same class as its next higher assembly in the manner described in the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Procedures Manual, DoD 4100.39-M.
